          <h2>Inspiration for innovation</h2>
          Aviation education programs are producing outstanding results, in some cases outperform their traditional education counter-parts by leaps and bounds. Many programs are accomplishing successful outcomes with very limited funding.
          Unfortunately, these programs have no contact with similar programs. They go at it alone. Aviation education comes with a unique set of challenges and educators are left to work through these challenges with no resources, often taking years to solve a problem that has already been solved by another program.
