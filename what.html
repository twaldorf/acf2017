            <li>Technology</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why</h3>
          <p>This type of collaboration improves the quality of all programs and significantly shortens the time needed to launch new initiatives. Workshops provide:</p>

            <li>Introductions to and inspiration from peers</li>
            <li>Freely exchanged best practices between programs with similar missions</li>
            <li>Mentoring and Coaching</li>
            <li>Access to proven tools to improve your teamâ€™s communication and implementation</li>
            <li>Unique content that is taught by subject matter experts from all industries</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Who</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Aviation education programs that desire to improve their specific program and aviation education as a whole.</li>
            <li>Programs who understand the benefits of a collaborative environment. </li>
            <li>Participants who are willing to share successes, best practices and more. </li>
